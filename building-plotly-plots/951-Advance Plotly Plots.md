3D Scatter Plots provide you ability to rotate the data so that you can investigate the data from different angles. Up to four variables (three numeric and one categorical) may be displayed on a single graph.

In the video below, we'll be performing Female Labour Force Participation Analysis using 3D scatter plot generated by Plotly. We will also animate the plot, and save as html to share with others.

The dataset, originally from https://ourworldindata.org/ has been clean and converted into a CSV file that can be accessed from here:

You must’ve seen these creative visualizations that so easily convey the data. It is also eye-catching and would deck up your presentation to the investors, won’t it? Let’s learn how we can create one using Plotly.
