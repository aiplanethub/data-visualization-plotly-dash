## Interactivity

Now let's cover how we can make our Dash apps interactive. In order to do this, we need to import Input and Output from dash.dependencies.

Don't confuse these with the HTML Input because they are different. The HTML Input is imported from the dash core components.

In the next slide, we create an input text and bind it to a callback such that whenever you type something into that box, it updates my-div in real time.

## Introduction to Dash Plotly

In the video below, we'll be creating a Dash app to understand what factors are affecting the bees population.
